BEHAVIOURAL and COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSES:

The FigureSwitch.m file computes the performances and proportions of switch and then plot them (ex. for experiments 1 & 2)

We also provide two example scripts that were used for model fitting (Model_3alpha_Expe1: RL model with 3 alphas; Fitting_Expe1: the script used to fit the model to the data using the optimset function). Additional modified scripts can be accessed upon request.
